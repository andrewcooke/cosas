various utilities and applications for the Music Thing Modular Workshop Computer.

the plan is to have a unified UI via the weas library.

significant waypoints:
* 2025-07-18 - use ComputerCard.h more directly (refactor rather than recreate)
* 2025-07-03 - can flash LEDs on the pico
* 2025-06-30 - can generate waveforms on the laptop and deploy an empty program to the pico
